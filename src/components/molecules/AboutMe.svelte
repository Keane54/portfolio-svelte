        During 2020 I had a lot of time on my hands and started to code, diving headfirst in to web development.
        Since then I've been a freelancer, worked at a <Link href="https://www.bookabuilderuk.com/" newTab={true}>small
        business</Link>, and now I'm part of a <Link href="https://www.adaptavist.com/" newTab={true}>large corporation</Link> as a Full Stack Developer.

        as well as leading development on a number of other tools and projects such as <Link href="https://www.reimaginingagile.com/" newTab={true}>Reimagining Agile</Link> and working in a multi-disciplinary team

        If I'm not doing anything code related I'm probably tending to my plants, chilling with my fianc√© and our 3 dogs, getting more leaves for
        our stick insects, or travelling the world!
